# Notbook style website
The website design should look like an notebook and the text is intended to perfectly fit  the lines.  I started to build this website to create a very simple and lightweight platform for writing short stories.

##Installation
Move folder to a php webserver. Create config.ini with mysql login data. Sqlite is not (yet) supported, if you want to support it, change some sql queries in the index.php.
